### Key Accomplishments

- **Data Preprocessing, PCA & Clustering**: Preprocessed the WorkerFunnel dataset, performed Principal Component Analysis (PCA) to explain 90% of the variance, and applied the Elbow method for K-Means clustering to segment worker productivity.
  
- **Time Series Forecasting with ARIMA**: Developed an ARIMA model to forecast productivity for the next four quarters, achieving evaluation metrics: RMSE: 0.0325, MSE: 0.00106, and MAPE: 0.0329.
  
- **Predictive Modeling & Budget Strategy**: Conducted clustering analysis and proposed a revised budget allocation strategy to enhance productivity in garment manufacturing operations.
